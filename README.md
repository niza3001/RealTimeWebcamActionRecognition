# Real-time Pretend Play Action Recognition on Webcam Stream
This repository is a modification of this repository:
https://github.com/danbochman/Real-Time-Action-Recognition

This work is based on Two-Stream network based on Jeffrey Huang's work:  
https://github.com/jeffreyhuang1/two-stream-action-recognition  
Also utilizing AlexHex7's PyTorch implementation of the Non-Local Block to enhance the spatial CNN of the Two-Stream network:  https://github.com/AlexHex7/Non-local_pytorch/blob/master/Non-Local_pytorch_0.3.1/lib/backup/non_local_simple_version.py

For instructions on how to run in demo, train or test mode please refer to the above repositories.
